# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh  

This app is made with the first one.

To run the app locally, go into the root folder and run  
`npm i` to install the dependencies and then run `npm run dev` to run the development server.  
You can also view the app on various mobile/tablet devices by visiting `<your-ip>:5173`
